**Last updated May 6, 2022**

Walla Software, Inc. ("Company" or "We" or "Us" or "Our" or “Walla”) respects your privacy and we are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. 

This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit the website https://hellowalla.com (our "Website") and/or utilize our Service sand our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information. Please refer to the for any capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy. 

In this policy, we layout: the types of data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights to your data.

In a nutshell:

We collect as little data as possible for Walla to effectively operate. The specifics are detailed in this document.

Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our Website and/or the Services. By accessing or using this Website and/or the Services, you agree to this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time (see `Changes and questions`). Your continued use of this Website and/or the Services after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check this policy periodically for updates.

## What we collect and why
We collect several types of information from and about users of our Website and/or Services. The types of information is detailed below.

We collect this information:
- Directly from you when you provide it to us.
- Automatically as you navigate through the Website and/or utilize the Services.Information collected automatically may include usage details, IP addresses, and information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies.
- From third parties, for example, our Customers, subprocessors and business partners.

You can see a list of all subprocessors who handle personal data for Walla on our [subprocessors](subprocessors) webpage.

### Identity & access

When you sign up for a Walla, we typically ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, and a company name. We also give you the option to add a profile picture that displays in our products.

### Billing information

When you pay for a Walla, we ask for your credit card and billing address. Your credit card is passed directly to our payment processor and doesn’t ever go through our servers. We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number and as-of billing address, for account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing address to calculate any sales tax due in the United States or VAT in the EU, to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, and to print on your invoices. We use Stripe for third-party secure payment processing.

You may read more about our payment processor's privacy policies [here](https://stripe.com/privacy).

### Geolocation data

We log all access to all accounts by full IP address so that we can always verify no unauthorized access has happened. We may keep this login data for as long as your product account is active.

Web analytics data — described further in the Website Interactions section — are also tied temporarily to IP addresses to assist with troubleshooting cases. We blind all web analytics data after 30 days.

### Website interactions

When you browse our marketing pages or applications, your browser automatically shares certain information such as which operating system and browser version you are using. We track that information, along with the pages you are visiting, page load timing, and which website referred you for statistical purposes like conversion rates and to test new designs. We sometimes track specific link clicks to help inform some design decisions. These web analytics data are tied to your IP address and user account if applicable and you are signed into our Services. Other web analytics we utilize are described further in the Cookies and Do Not Track section.

More information can be found on our [security webpage](/security).

### Cookies and Do Not Track

We do use persistent first-party cookies to store certain preferences, make it easier for you to use our applications.

We partner with Google and Facebook for some marketing activities. If you are coming to Walla from a Google or Facebook ad, and are in the United States, the advertiser will send a cookie to your browser to determine whether you visited Walla because of a particular advertisement you viewed. This enables us to evaluate the effectiveness of these ads.

A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. It may help remember login information and site preferences. It might also collect information such as your browser type, operating system, web pages visited, duration of visit, content viewed, and other click-stream data. You can adjust cookie retention settings in your own browser. To learn more about cookies, including how to view which cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, please visit: [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org).

At this time, our sites and applications do not respond to Do Not Track beacons sent by browser plugins.

### Voluntary correspondence

When you write us with a question or to ask for help, we may keep that correspondence, including the email address, so
that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future.

We also store any information you volunteer like surveys. Sometimes when we do customer interviews, we may ask for your
permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We only do so if you give your express consent.

### Mobile app permissions

We offer optional mobile apps for Walla. Our philosophy is to ask for the bare minimum of permissions from you to give you a great app experience with maximum privacy. By default, we have access to the network to ensure the app can connect to and communicate with the Internet. In most cases, we ask for permission just-in-time so that you can decide if you want to grant access to things like contacts, camera, and calendar. A few exceptions:

For our iOS apps, we'll ask for permission to use push notifications upon first sign-in.
Android apps do not require permission to send push notifications.

It’s impossible for our apps to try to use a sensitive OS feature without requesting access explicitly from you, so you’ll always know exactly when and what we’re requesting. You will never be required to grant any permission (although a given feature may not work or work well without it).

### Information we do not collect

#### Children under the age of 16 
Our services are not intended for children under 16 years of age. No one under age 16 may provide any personal information to or on the Website and/or Services. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you are under 16, do not use or provide any information on this Website or through any of its features, register on the Website, make any purchases through the Website, use any of the interactive or public comment features of this Website, use the Services, or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any screen name or user name you may use. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 16 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us at [support@hellowalla.com](mailto:support@hellowalla.com) or via phone at 858-293-1011

#### Other identifying information

We don’t collect any characteristics of protected classifications including age, race, gender, religion, sexual
orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or physical and mental abilities or disabilities. You may provide these
data voluntarily, such as if you include a pronoun preference in your email signature when writing into our Support
team.

We also do not collect any biometric data. You are given the option to add a picture to your user profile, which could be a real picture of you or a picture of something else that represents you best. We do not extract any information from profile pictures.

## When we access or share your information

Our default practice is to not access your information. The only times we’ll ever access or share your info are:

**To provide products or services you’ve requested**. As mentioned above, we do use some third-party services to run our
applications and only to the extent necessary process some or all of your personal information via these third parties.
Having subprocessors means we are using technology to access your data. No Walla human looks at your data for these
purposes unless an error occurs that stops an automated process from working and requires manual intervention to fix.
These are rare cases and when they happen, we look for root cause solutions as much as possible to avoid them from
reoccurring.

**To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.** If at any point we need to access your
account to help you with a Support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.

**To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses.** Accessing a customer’s account when investigating
potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We have an obligation to protect the privacy and safety of both our
customers and the people reporting issues to us. We do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the
process. If we do discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will report the incident to the
appropriate authorities.

**When required under applicable law.**

Walla Software, Inc. is a US company and all data infrastructure are located in the US.

- If US law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring we share
  data, we have to comply. Otherwise, we flat-out reject requests from local and federal law enforcement when they seek
  data. And unless we’re legally prevented from it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are made. In the event a
  government authority outside the US approaches Walla with a request, our default stance is to refuse unless the US
  government compels us to comply through procedures outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement. **_We
  have never received a National Security Letter or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) order._**
- Similarly, if we receive a request to preserve data, we refuse unless compelled by either the US Federal Stored
  Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f) or a properly served US subpoena for civil matters. In both of these
  situations, we have to comply. In these situations, we notify affected customers as soon as possible unless we are
  legally prohibited from doing so. We do not share preserved data unless absolutely required under the Stored
  Communications Act or compelled by a court order that we choose not to appeal. Furthermore, unless we receive a proper
  warrant, court order, or subpoena before the required preservation period expires, we destroy any preserved copies we
  made of customer data once the preservation period lapses.
- If we get an informal request from any person, organization, or entity, we do not assist.
- If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to share billing-related information. If that happens, we
  only share the bare minimum needed such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.

Finally, if Walla Software, Inc is acquired by or merged with another company — we don’t plan on that, but if
it happens — we’ll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy
policy.

## Your rights with respect to your information

We apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Currently some of the most privacy-forward
regulations in place are the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and California Consumer
Privacy Act (“CCPA”) in the US. Walla recognizes all of the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by
applicable law. These rights include:

- **Right to Know.** You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline
  both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
- **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right
  to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
- **Right to Correction.** You have the right to request correction of your personal information.
- **Right to Erasure / “To be Forgotten”.** This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under
  applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, all of our service
  providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using Walla services because our
  applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.
- **Right to Complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with
  the appropriate supervisory authority. To identify your specific authority or find out more about this right, EU
  individuals should go
  to [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).
- **Right to Restrict Processing.** This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information
  is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell
  your personal data.)
- **Right to Object.** You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is
  processed.
- **Right to Portability.** You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to
  transmit it to another party.
- **Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.** You have the right to object and prevent any decision that
  could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This
  right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed
  by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.
- **Right to Non-Discrimination.** This right stems from the CCPA. We do not and will not charge you a different amount
  to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have
  exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right “to be forgotten”) may,
  by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.

Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account information.

If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us
at [support@hellowalla.com](mailto:support@hellowalla.com) or at Walla Software, Inc PO Box 10 Cardiff By The Sea,
CA 92007. For requests to delete personal information or know what personal information has been collected, we will
first verify your identity using a combination of at least two pieces of information already collected including your
user email address. If an authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will first need written consent with a
signature from the account holder before proceeding.

If you are in the EU, you can identify your specific authority to file a complaint or find out more about GDPR,
at [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).

## How we secure your data

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted from our
servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted.

For more information about how we keep your information secure, please review our [security overview](/security).

## What happens when you delete data in your product accounts

Walla gives you the option to delete your account completely from all Walla systems. All account and associated data will immediately be deleted from Walla's databases upon account deletion.

The encrypted backups of our application databases, which are kept for up to another 30 days, include account data which
can persist for a maximum of 30 days after account deletion. After those backups are rotated out, your data will no
longer exist on any Walla system and will never be recoverable. 

In total, when you delete your Walla account, it
is purged within 30 days from all of our systems. Retrieving data for a single account from a backup is cost-prohibitive
and unduly burdensome so if you change your mind and want to use Walla again, you will have to re-register with a new
account.

## Location of site and data

Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States. Your data will never leave the United States.
If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, **please be aware that any
information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States**. By using our Site, participating
in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.

## When transferring personal data from the EU

The GDPR requires that any data transferred out of the EU must be treated with the same level of protection that the EU
privacy laws grant. The privacy laws of the United States generally do not meet that requirement. That is why since GDPR
went into effect, Walla has offered a data processing addendum and voluntarily participated in the EU-US Privacy
Shield Framework as well as the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework.

We have incorporated a [Data Processing Addendum](/dpa) to our [Terms of Service](/terms) that is in effect when the
GDPR applies to your use of Walla to process Customer Data as defined in the DPA. The DPA includes the European
Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (both controller-processor and controller-controller) to extend GDPR privacy
principles, rights, and obligations everywhere personal data is processed. If you prefer to have an executed copy of the
Data Processing Addendum, you may email [support@hellowalla.com](mailto:support@hellowalla.com) and request a copy.
Regardless of whether you execute or not, we protect and secure your data to the high standards set out in the addendum.

## EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield policy

The EU-US [Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/) is an agreement between certain European jurisdictions and
the United States that up until July 16, 2020, allowed for the transfer of personal data from the EU to the US.
Participation in the Privacy Shield program is voluntary. The Swiss-US Privacy Shield is a similar program for data
transferred to the US from Switzerland that was in effect until September 8, 2020.

### We comply with the frameworks for EU, UK, and Swiss data that are transferred into the United States

Walla complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by
the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from
the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. We’ve certified to the
Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in
this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles take precedent. To learn more about
the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please
visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov/](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).

Walla is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with regard to the
Privacy Shield Frameworks.

The Privacy Shield Frameworks uphold specific principles, many of which are already outlined in the section on Your
Rights. For clarity, pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, the following principles apply to all EU, UK, and Swiss
data that has been transferred into the United States:

- Individuals have the right to access their personal data and to update, correct, and/or amend information that is
  incomplete. Individuals also have the right to request erasure of personal information that has been processed in
  violation of the principles. Individuals wishing to exercise these rights may do so by by signing in and directly
  updating your account information. If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please
  contact us at [support@hellowalla.com](mailto:support@hellowalla.com) or at Walla Software, Inc PO Box 10 Cardiff
  By The Sea, CA 92007 Cardiff By The Sea, CA 92007.
- We remain liable for the onward transfer of personal data to third parties acting as our agents unless we can prove we
  were not a party to the events giving rise to the damages.
- We do not sell personal data nor do we permit it to be used for reasons other than those for which it was originally
  provided. If this practice should change in the future, we will update this policy accordingly and provide individuals
  with opt-out or opt-in choice as appropriate.
- We may be required to release personal data in response to lawful requests from public authorities including to meet
  national security and law enforcement requirements.

### We commit to resolving all complaints

In compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, we commit to resolve
complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union, United Kingdom, or
Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Walla at
support@hellowalla.com, or by mail at Walla Software, Inc PO Box 10 Cardiff By The Sea, CA 92007 Cardiff By The
Sea, CA 92007.

Walla has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles and the
Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated
by BBB National Programs. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not
satisfactorily addressed, please
visit [https://bbbprograms.org/privacy-shield-complaints/](https://bbbprograms.org/privacy-shield-complaints/) for more
information and to file a complaint. This service is provided at no cost to you. Please do not submit GDPR complaints to
BBB EU Privacy Shield.

If your EU-US Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through these described channels, under certain conditions,
you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. To learn more,
please view the Privacy Shield Annex 1
at [https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction).

## Changes & questions

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. Whenever we make
a significant change to our policies, we will also announce them on our [company blog](/blog).

Have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, your data, or your rights with respect to your
information? Please get in touch by emailing us at [support@hellowalla.com](mailto:support@hellowalla.com) and we’ll be happy to answer them!
