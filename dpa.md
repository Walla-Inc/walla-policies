Walla’s Affiliates may be retained as Sub-processors; and (b) Walla and

Walla’s Affiliates respectively may engage third-party Sub-processors in connection

preceding sentence, Walla will use reasonable efforts to make available to Customer a change in the Services or

terminate the applicable Agreement with respect only to those Services which cannot be provided by Walla without the
use of the objected-to new Sub-processor by providing written notice to Walla. Walla will refund Customer any
prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of such Agreement following the effective date of termination with
respect to such terminated Services, without imposing a penalty for such termination on Customer.

otherwise set forth in the Agreement.

measures for protection of the security (including protection against unauthorized or unlawful Processing and against
accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration or damage, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Customer

deems necessary and reasonable in order to remediate the cause of such a Customer Data
Incident to the extent the remediation is within Walla’s reasonable control. The
obligations herein shall not apply to incidents that are caused by Customer or Customer’s
Invited Users.

### 9. RETURN AND DELETION OF CUSTOMER DATA

Walla shall return Customer Data to Customer and, to the extent allowed by
applicable law, delete Customer Data in accordance with the procedures and timeframes
specified in the Security, Privacy and Architecture Documentation.

and seek remedies under this DPA, subject to the following:

10.3.1 Except where applicable Data Protection Laws and Regulations require the
Authorized Affiliate to exercise a right or seek any remedy under this DPA
against Walla directly by itself, the parties agree that (i) solely the
Customer that is the contracting party to the Agreement shall exercise any such
right or seek any such remedy on behalf of the Authorized Affiliate, and (ii) the
Customer that is the contracting party to the Agreement shall exercise any such
rights under this DPA not separately for each Authorized Affiliate individually
but in a combined manner for all of its Authorized Affiliates together (as set
forth, for example, in Section 10 .3.2, below).

10.3.2 The parties agree that the Customer that is the contracting party to the
Agreement shall, when carrying out an on-site audit of the procedures relevant
to the protection of Personal Data, take all reasonable measures to limit any
impact on Walla and its Sub-processors by combining, to the extent
reasonably possible, several audit requests carried out on behalf of different
Authorized Affiliates in one single audit.

### 11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

of or related to this DPA, and all DPAs between Authorized Affiliates and Walla,

of liability set forth in the Agreement, and such limitations apply to the aggregate liability
of that party and all of its Affiliates under the Agreement and all DPAs together.

For the avoidance of doubt, Walla’s and its Affiliates’ total liability for all claims
from the Customer and all of its Authorized Affiliates arising out of or related to the
Agreement and each DPA shall apply in the aggregate for all claims under both the
Agreement and all DPAs established under this Agreement, including by Customer and
all Authorized Affiliates, and, in particular, shall not be understood to apply individually

(j) to send promptly a copy of any subprocessor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the data exporter.

Clause 6
Liability

1. The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations
   referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from the
   data exporter for the damage suffered.

2. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data
   exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in
   Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become
   insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were
   the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by
   contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.

The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order
to avoid its own liabilities.

3. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in
   paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3
   or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in
   law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data
   subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the
   data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data
   importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such
   entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

Clause 7
Mediation and jurisdiction

1. The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims
   compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject:

(a) to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable,
by the supervisory authority;
(b) to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is
established.

2. The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to
   seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law.

Clause 8
Cooperation with supervisory authorities

1. The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if
   such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law.

2. The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any
   subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data
   exporter under the applicable data protection law.
3. The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any
   subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2.
   In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b).

Clause 9
Governing Law

The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.

Clause 10
Variation of the contract

The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on
business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.

Clause 11
Subprocessing

1. The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter
   under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its
   obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written
   agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data
   importer under the Clauses. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written
   agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor’s
   obligations under such agreement.
2. The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party
   beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for
   compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have
   factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the
   entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party
   liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

3. The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall
   be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.
4. The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data
   importer pursuant to Clause 5(j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the
   data exporter’s data protection supervisory authority.

Clause 12
Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services

1. The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the
   subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies
   thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done
   so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the
   personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the
   personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.
2. The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory
   authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.

Standard Contractual Clauses (controllers)
Data transfer agreement
between

The entity identified as “ **Customer** ” in the DPA (the data **exporter)**

and

Rock n Roll Dance Party, LLC PO Box 10 Cardiff By The Sea, CA 92007 Cardiff By The Sea, CA 92007

each a “party”; together “the parties”.

**Definitions**

For the purposes of the clauses:

a) “personal data”, “special categories of data/sensitive data”, “process/processing”, “controller”,
“processor”, “data subject” and “supervisory authority/authority” shall have the same meaning as
in Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995 (whereby “the authority” shall mean the competent data
protection authority in the territory in which the data exporter is established);

b) “the data exporter” shall mean the controller who transfers the personal data;

c) “the data importer” shall mean the controller who agrees to receive from the data exporter personal
data for further processing in accordance with the terms of these clauses and who is not subject to
a third country’s system ensuring adequate protection;

d) “clauses” shall mean these contractual clauses, which are a free-standing document that does not
incorporate commercial business terms established by the parties under separate commercial
arrangements.

The details of the transfer (as well as the personal data covered) are specified in Annex B, which forms an integral
part of the clauses.

I. Obligations of the data exporter

The data exporter warrants and undertakes that:
a) The personal data have been collected, processed and transferred in accordance with the laws
applicable to the data exporter.

b) It has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able to satisfy its legal
obligations under these clauses.

c) It will provide the data importer, when so requested, with copies of relevant data protection laws or
references to them (where relevant, and not including legal advice) of the country in which the
data exporter is established.

d) It will respond to enquiries from data subjects and the authority concerning processing of the
personal data by the data importer, unless the parties have agreed that the data importer will so
respond, in which case the data exporter will still respond to the extent reasonably possible and
with the information reasonably available to it if the data importer is unwilling or unable to
respond. Responses will be made within a reasonable time.

e) It will make available, upon request, a copy of the clauses to data subjects who are third party
beneficiaries under clause III, unless the clauses contain confidential information, in which case it
may remove such information. Where information is removed, the data exporter shall inform data
subjects in writing of the reason for removal and of their right to draw the removal to the attention
of the authority. However, the data exporter shall abide by a decision of the authority regarding
access to the full text of the clauses by data subjects, as long as data subjects have agreed to
respect the confidentiality of the confidential information removed. The data exporter shall also
provide a copy of the clauses to the authority where required.

**II. Obligations of the data importer**

The data importer warrants and undertakes that:
a) It will have in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal data
against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or
access, and which provide a level of security appropriate to the risk represented by the processing
and the nature of the data to be protected.

b) It will have in place procedures so that any third party it authorises to have access to the personal
data, including processors, will respect and maintain the confidentiality and security of the
personal data. Any person acting under the authority of the data importer, including a data
processor, shall be obligated to process the personal data only on instructions from the data
importer. This provision does not apply to persons authorised or required by law or regulation to
have access to the personal data.

c) It has no reason to believe, at the time of entering into these clauses, in the existence of any local
laws that would have a substantial adverse effect on the guarantees provided for under these
clauses, and it will inform the data exporter (which will pass such notification on to the authority
where required) if it becomes aware of any such laws.

d) It will process the personal data for purposes described in Annex B, and has the legal authority to
give the warranties and fulfil the undertakings set out in these clauses.

e) It will identify to the data exporter a contact point within its organisation authorised to respond to
enquiries concerning processing of the personal data, and will cooperate in good faith with the data
exporter, the data subject and the authority concerning all such enquiries within a reasonable time.
In case of legal dissolution of the data exporter, or if the parties have so agreed, the data importer
will assume responsibility for compliance with the provisions of clause I(e).

f) At the request of the data exporter, it will provide the data exporter with evidence of financial
resources sufficient to fulfil its responsibilities under clause III (which may include insurance
coverage).

g) Upon reasonable request of the data exporter, it will submit its data processing facilities, data files
and documentation needed for processing to reviewing, auditing and/or certifying by the data
exporter (or any independent or impartial inspection agents or auditors, selected by the data
exporter and not reasonably objected to by the data importer) to ascertain compliance with the
warranties and undertakings in these clauses, with reasonable notice and during regular business
hours. The request will be subject to any necessary consent or approval from a regulatory or
supervisory authority within the country of the data importer, which consent or approval the data
importer will attempt to obtain in a timely fashion.

h) It will process the personal data, at its option, in accordance with:

i. the data protection laws of the country in which the data exporter is established, or

ii. the relevant provisions^1 of any Commission decision pursuant to Article 25(6) of Directive
95/46/EC, where the data importer complies with the relevant provisions of such an
authorisation or decision and is based in a country to which such an authorisation or
decision pertains, but is not covered by such authorisation or decision for the purposes of
the transfer(s) of the personal data^2 , or

iii. the data processing principles set forth in Annex A.

Data importer to indicate which option it selects: Option (iii)
Initials of data importer: ............................................................................................ ;
i) It will not disclose or transfer the personal data to a third party data controller located outside the
European Economic Area (EEA) unless it notifies the data exporter about the transfer and

i. the third party data controller processes the personal data in accordance with a
Commission decision finding that a third country provides adequate protection, or

ii. the third party data controller becomes a signatory to these clauses or another data transfer
agreement approved by a competent authority in the EU, or

(^1) “Relevant provisions” means those provisions of any authorisation or decision except for the enforcement provisions
of any authorisation or decision (which shall be governed by these clauses).
(^2) However, the provisions of Annex A.5 concerning rights of access, rectification, deletion and objection must be
applied when this option is chosen and take precedence over any comparable provisions of the Commission Decision
selected.

iii. data subjects have been given the opportunity to object, after having been informed of the
purposes of the transfer, the categories of recipients and the fact that the countries to which
data is exported may have different data protection standards, or

iv. with regard to onward transfers of sensitive data, data subjects have given their
unambiguous consent to the onward transfer

**III. Liability and third party rights**

a) Each party shall be liable to the other parties for damages it causes by any breach of these clauses.
Liability as between the parties is limited to actual damage suffered. Punitive damages (i.e.
damages intended to punish a party for its outrageous conduct) are specifically excluded. Each
party shall be liable to data subjects for damages it causes by any breach of third party rights under
these clauses. This does not affect the liability of the data exporter under its data protection law.

b) The parties agree that a data subject shall have the right to enforce as a third party beneficiary this
clause and clauses I(b), I(d), I(e), II(a), II(c), II(d), II(e), II(h), II(i), III(a), V, VI(d) and VII against
the data importer or the data exporter, for their respective breach of their contractual obligations,
with regard to his personal data, and accept jurisdiction for this purpose in the data exporter’s
country of establishment. In cases involving allegations of breach by the data importer, the data
subject must first request the data exporter to take appropriate action to enforce his rights against
the data importer; if the data exporter does not take such action within a reasonable period (which
under normal circumstances would be one month), the data subject may then enforce his rights
against the data importer directly. A data subject is entitled to proceed directly against a data
exporter that has failed to use reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able to
satisfy its legal obligations under these clauses (the data exporter shall have the burden to prove
that it took reasonable efforts).

**IV. Law applicable to the clauses**

These clauses shall be governed by the law of the country in which the data exporter is established, with
the exception of the laws and regulations relating to processing of the personal data by the data importer
under clause II(h), which shall apply only if so selected by the data importer under that clause.
V. Resolution of disputes with data subjects or the authority

a) In the event of a dispute or claim brought by a data subject or the authority concerning the
processing of the personal data against either or both of the parties, the parties will inform each
other about any such disputes or claims, and will cooperate with a view to settling them amicably
in a timely fashion.

b) The parties agree to respond to any generally available non-binding mediation procedure initiated
by a data subject or by the authority. If they do participate in the proceedings, the parties may elect
to do so remotely (such as by telephone or other electronic means). The parties also agree to
consider participating in any other arbitration, mediation or other dispute resolution proceedings
developed for data protection disputes.

c) Each party shall abide by a decision of a competent court of the data exporter’s country of
establishment or of the authority which is final and against which no further appeal is possible.

VI. Termination

a) In the event that the data importer is in breach of its obligations under these clauses, then the data
exporter may temporarily suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until the breach
is repaired or the contract is terminated.

b) In the event that:

i. the transfer of personal data to the data importer has been temporarily suspended by the
data exporter for longer than one month pursuant to paragraph (a);

ii. compliance by the data importer with these clauses would put it in breach of its legal or
regulatory obligations in the country of import;

iii. the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of any warranties or undertakings
given by it under these clauses;

iv. a final decision against which no further appeal is possible of a competent court of the data
exporter’s country of establishment or of the authority rules that there has been a breach of
the clauses by the data importer or the data exporter; or

v. a petition is presented for the administration or winding up of the data importer, whether
in its personal or business capacity, which petition is not dismissed within the applicable
period for such dismissal under applicable law; a winding up order is made; a receiver is
appointed over any of its assets; a trustee in bankruptcy is appointed, if the data importer is
an individual; a company voluntary arrangement is commenced by it; or any equivalent
event in any jurisdiction occurs

then the data exporter, without prejudice to any other rights which it may have against the data
importer, shall be entitled to terminate these clauses, in which case the authority shall be informed
where required. In cases covered by (i), (ii), or (iv) above the data importer may also terminate
these clauses.
c) Either party may terminate these clauses if (i) any Commission positive adequacy decision under
Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC (or any superseding text) is issued in relation to the country
(or a sector thereof) to which the data is transferred and processed by the data importer, or (ii)
Directive 95/46/EC (or any superseding text) becomes directly applicable in such country.

d) The parties agree that the termination of these clauses at any time, in any circumstances and for
whatever reason (except for termination under clause VI(c)) does not exempt them from the
obligations and/or conditions under the clauses as regards the processing of the personal data
transferred.

**VII. Variation of these clauses**

The parties may not modify these clauses except to update any information in Annex B, in which case they
will inform the authority where required. This does not preclude the parties from adding additional
commercial clauses where required.

**VIII. Description of the Transfer**

The details of the transfer and of the personal data are specified in Annex B. The parties agree that Annex
B may contain confidential business information which they will not disclose to third parties, except as
required by law or in response to a competent regulatory or government agency, or as required under
clause I(e). The parties may execute additional annexes to cover additional transfers, which will be
submitted to the authority where required. Annex B may, in the alternative, be drafted to cover multiple
transfers.

ANNEX A
DATA PROCESSING PRINCIPLES

1. Purpose limitation: Personal data may be processed and subsequently used or further communicated only for purposes
   described in Annex B or subsequently authorised by the data subject.
2. Data quality and proportionality: Personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. The personal
   data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are transferred and
   further processed.
3. Transparency: Data subjects must be provided with information necessary to ensure fair processing
   (such as information about the purposes of processing and about the transfer), unless such information has already
   been given by the data exporter.
4. Security and confidentiality: Technical and organisational security measures must be taken by the data controller
   that are appropriate to the risks, such as against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration,
   unauthorised disclosure or access, presented by the processing. Any person acting under the authority of the data
   controller, including a processor, must not process the data except on instructions from the data controller.
5. Rights of access, rectification, deletion and objection: As provided in Article 12 of Directive 95/46/EC, data
   subjects must, whether directly or via a third party, be provided with the personal information about them that an
   organisation holds, except for requests which are manifestly abusive, based on unreasonable intervals or their number
   or repetitive or systematic nature, or for which access need not be granted under the law of the country of the data
   exporter. Provided that the authority has given its prior approval, access need also not be granted when doing so
   would be likely to seriously harm the interests of the data importer or other organisations dealing with the data
   importer and such interests are not overridden by the interests for fundamental rights and freedoms of the data
   subject. The sources of the personal data need not be identified when this is not possible by reasonable efforts, or
   where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. Data subjects must be able to have the
   personal information about them rectified, amended, or deleted where it is inaccurate or processed against these
   principles. If there are compelling grounds to doubt the legitimacy of the request, the organisation may require
   further justifications before proceeding to rectification, amendment or deletion. Notification of any rectification,
   amendment or deletion to third parties to whom the data have been disclosed need not be made when this involves a
   disproportionate effort. A data subject must also be able to object to the processing of the personal data relating
   to him if there are compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation. The burden of proof for any
   refusal rests on the data importer, and the data subject may always challenge a refusal before the authority.
6. Sensitive data: The data importer shall take such additional measures (e.g. relating to security) as are necessary to
   protect such sensitive data in accordance with its obligations under clause II.

7. Data used for marketing purposes: Where data are processed for the purposes of direct marketing, effective procedures
   should exist allowing the data subject at any time to “opt-out” from having his data used for such purposes.
8. Automated decisions: For purposes hereof “automated decision” shall mean a decision by the data exporter or the data
   importer which produces legal effects concerning a data subject or significantly affects a data subject and which is
   based solely on automated processing of personal data intended to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to him,
   such as his performance at work, creditworthiness, reliability, conduct, etc. The data importer shall not make any
   automated decisions concerning data subjects, except when:

a) i. such decisions are made by the data importer in entering into or performing a contract with the data subject, and

ii. the data subject is given an opportunity to discuss the results of a relevant automated decision with a
representative of the parties making such decision or otherwise to make representations to that parties.

or

c) where otherwise provided by the law of the data exporter.
